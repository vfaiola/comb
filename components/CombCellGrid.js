/*
collection of cells into a grid.
The central lower cluster cell is the initial draw point for the grid.
Is polite enough to return the draw point to where it was before the shape was

CAN:
-display a grid of cells to represent a key
-assign chords to cells (currently just strings rather than actual chord objects)

CAN'T:
-do much yet

DEPENDS ON: CombCell.js
