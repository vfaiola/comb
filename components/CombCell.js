/*
Class for Comb hex cells
meant to function as the basic button class, particularly for the main chord grid.

NOTE: this mouseover detection is ULTRA SLOW PERFORMANCE and needs to be replaced.
HOW MOUSEOVER DETECTION WORKS:
this class detects mouseovers with a "map" color on each shape, which is displayed before the
user viewable display color. This color is checked against the color under the mouse when the 
mouse is pressed (mouseIsPressed boolean check). The acutal map color doesn't matter, as long as
it a) isn't the same color as the background, and b) the display color of the clicked button changes
when it is clicked. This is because the event checking is done during the Cell's display stage, 
between the mapDisplay and the user display. Effectivly a "Just In Time" event check. Cells drawn earlier
see the mouse as hovering over the background color. Cells drawn later see the mouse as hovering over the 
user displayable color. In this way, each button can detect mouse-over without having to be assigned 
unique map colors, nor some elaborite coordinate range/distance formula system. I've started calling this the
"Duckhunt" pattern.

CAN:
-display basic shape with fill color
-detect mouseIsPressed over individual Cells, and respond accordingly. Changes color atm
-keep track of how many cells their are, and each cell is numbered in draw order currently
-be used publicly without exposing implementation
CAN'T:
-model components are mostly unimplemented
-play chords yet

DEPENDS ON:
p5.js
